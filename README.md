## Section 1 Introduction and Purpose

### Introduction 
* This is  a simple Photo sharing application made on Ruby on Rails. User can view photos, comments, etc. by clicking on the name link.
This application has comment section which has pre entered data using SQLite database. The images used for this application is stored in S3 bucket. Docker image of this project created and stored on Docker Hub. This application is deployed and run on AWS EC2 instance using docker image from Docker Hub.
EC2 instance support Elastic IP address so, that EC2 instance Start and Stop Instance doesn't change public IP addess for access of PhotoSharing application.
This EC2 instance has image copy saved so, that when EC2 instance is under heavy load or has failure copy is this EC2 instance can be luanched for load balancing without need to PhotoSite Software deployment again and quickly.

8. In Properties section you can see the Object URL.


### Steps Followed to Create Ruby on Rails Application.
 *  Create a new Rails application project .
 
        New Project -> Rails -> application -> add Ruby SDK and Rails version. For database select sqlite3. Click Create.
 * Create three models for user, photo and comment.

 
 		Go to Tools -> Run Rails Generator -> Name the model.
 	
 * Go to
 
 		db->migrate 
 You will see files generated corresponding to the user, photo and comment. Add the columns you want to add in the database and specify their data type. 
 
 *  Create a new data migration file load_data which will have pre configured data. ( This data file is taken from Professor's website )
 To add this file go to 
 
 		Tools-> Run Rails Generator -> migration and name it load_data. 
 Now you can see there are four migration files in db -> migrate.
 * Now Run the migration file by the following command RubyMine IDE: 

 		Tools->Run Rake Task -> db:migrate
  * Now to view tables :
     1. Go to Databses in the right.
     2. Click on + symbol.

     3. Go to import data sources.
     
     4. Click SQLite
     5. Click Create.
     6. To view go to
     
     			databases -> Rails PhotoSite development -> schemas -> main -> click users
![screenshot image](screenshot/db_2.png)
* Create two controllers for user, and photo.
* Go to views and crete index.html.erb file for photo and user.
* Go to folder 

		views -> photo -> index.html.erb. Add the path of S3 bucket URL which contains image.

#### Docker Container

* First, we create application on local device such as laptops/computers. Then, docker is used to create image of local Ruby on Rails application. Then, this image is used by AWS EC2 instance. 

 Docker is used to create image because it reduces the burden of installing each and every dependencies of application seperately. The image created by docker can directly be deployed by AWS EC2 instance.
 
 To create a docker image of our application we need to add the docker file and docker-compose.yml file in our local Ruby on Rails Application. Then, we need to create a repository in Docker Hub. After creating the repository, we will create a  docker image of our application. This image is used by EC2 instance.
 
 Further details about docker is given below.

## SECTION 5) Special Issue 1

###  What happens when an instance stops running?

When the instance stops running we may loose our data.

###  Solution:


#### AWS EC2 instance's image creation
AWS EC2 instance's image help to create and deploy copy of existing EC2 instance
for load balancing when one instance has fault or under heavy load of traffic.
New EC2 instance creation from AWS EC2 instance's image follow normal flow of Instance creation after Step #4 mentioned below and it already has SW deployed for instance from which image is created & ready to run.

1. Go to EC2 instance, select the EC2 instance.

2. Right click on the Instance and then go to "Image and Templates" and select "Create image".
![screenshot image](screenshot/30.png)

3. Enter "Image Name" and "Image description" and click create to create image
![screenshot image](screenshot/31.png)

4. Select "AMIs" in Left Side selection link to view and launch instance of newely created image. To launch EC2 instance creation from images - select image box and click Launch and follow normal EC2 instance creation flow.
![screenshot image](screenshot/33.png)



### SECTION 6) Special Issue 2

#### What happens when reboot instance & what can you do?

When we reboot the instance the IP address changes.

#### Solution:


#### AWS EC2 instance's Elastic IPs

An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address. With the help of Elastic IP address we can mask this failure of our instance. This can be done by remapping the address to another instance in our account. Suppose, if our instance does not have a public IP address then, we can associate Elastic IP address  with our instance in order to make it communicate with internet.

AWS impose small hourly charge if an Elastic IP address is not  associated with a running state. It also impose small hourly charge for an instance which is associated with a stopped instance. When we are running our instance we are not charged for one Elastic IP address which is associated with the instance. However, they will charge for any additional Elastic IP address associated with the instance.  


An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is allocated to EC2 instance until it is released. So, anytime EC2 instance is stop and start (until terminated), it can use same IP address for public access.

1. Select the EC2 instance and in Left side selection panel select "Elastic IPs"
![screenshot image](screenshot/32.png)

2. Select "Allocate Elastic IP address"
![screenshot image](screenshot/34.png)

3. Select "Amazon's Pool of IPv4 address" 
![screenshot image](screenshot/35.png)

4. Select "Action" drop down and click "Associate Elastic IP address"
![screenshot image](screenshot/36.png)

5. Select one of availabel "Private IP address" and check "Allow this Elastic address to be reassociated" and then click "Associate"
![screenshot image](screenshot/37.png)
![screenshot image](screenshot/38.png)

6. Check the EC2 instance's "Details" section for "Elastic IP addresses".
Also on Left side selection panel select "Elastic IPs" to see details of Elastic IP address
